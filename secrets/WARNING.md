README - WARNING - README

Do not do what I have done here. Secrets should not be in a public repo.
How can we have a good example that isn't in public? I don't know, but it's
a bad idea to put (even encrypted) secrets in a public repository like this.

We're going to have to delete this, and replace it with a reference to show
how secrets are meant to be handled in a more reasonable way (with a private
repository, say) and put up one of those "not a place of honor" do not dig
radioactive materials warning indicators. Do not store sensitive credentials
in a public place, even encrypted like this.
